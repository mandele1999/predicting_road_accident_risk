## Project Overview

Every day, countless drivers navigate roads of varying conditions â€” some wide and straight, others narrow and winding. Understanding which road conditions are more likely to lead to severe accidents can make a real difference in safety planning and road management.

This project tackles exactly that: *predicting road risk severity based on infrastructure, environmental, and situational factors.*
Itâ€™s a data science and machine learning case study focusing on model experimentation, interpretability, and generalization.

## Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts road accident risk using features such as `road type`, `lighting`, `weather`, and other `contextual conditions`.

We wanted not just an accurate model â€” but one thatâ€™s explainable, stable, and generalizes well beyond the training data.

## Data Overview

The dataset captures a mix of numeric, categorical, and boolean features representing the environment and road context:

`num_lanes`, `curvature`, `speed_limit`, `num_reported_accidents`, `road_type`, `lighting`, `weather`, `time_of_day`, `road_signs_present`, `public_road`, `holiday`, `school_season`.

Each record corresponds to a specific road segment and associated contextual conditions, labeled with its risk severity score.

Preprocessing included:
* Scaling numeric features
* One-hot encoding categorical columns
* Preserving boolean indicators as binary flags

Early analysis during data exploration revealed clear patterns â€” for instance, nighttime and dimly lit conditions correlated strongly with higher risk scores, while wider roads (with more lanes) generally indicated lower risk.


## Modeling Process

Our process followed a classic yet refined machine learning workflow:

**1. Baseline Modeling**
   * Established benchmark performance using several algorithms:
      * `Linear Regression`
      * `Random Forest`
      * `Gradient Boosting`
      * `CatBoost`
      * `XGBoost`

**2. Initial Findings**
   * **CatBoost** emerged as the top performer during baseline evaluation (**lowest RMSE on validation**).
   * We then used feature importance and **SHAP values** to interpret CatBoostâ€™s decisions globally and locally.

**3. Generalization Testing**

   * To verify robustness, we conducted **cross-validation (CV) RMSE analysis**.
   * Interestingly, **XGBoost** slightly outperformed **CatBoost** here â€” with lower mean RMSE and smaller standard deviation across folds.
   * This indicated better **stability** and **generalization**, making **XGBoost our final model of choice**.

### Key Insights
   * **Lighting** conditions and **weather** consistently ranked among the most influential **predictors** of risk severity.
   * **Speed limits** had a **nonlinear** relationship with severity â€” moderate speeds tended to correspond with fewer severe cases.
   * Presence of **road signs** and **school season** introduced subtle but meaningful contextual effects, showing how small situational cues can shift risk dynamics.

### Final Model

| Metric                             | Value                             |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Model                              | `XGBoost Regressor`               |
| Validation RMSE                    | *0.0563*                  |
| Cross-Validation RMSE (mean Â± std) | *0.0561 Â± 0.0001*             |
| Test Predictions                   | 172,585 rows (matching test size) |

### Reflections
* This project reinforced the importance of balancing *accuracy* and *interpretability*.

* A model that performs slightly better on validation might still fail to generalize well, and thatâ€™s where *cross-validation* and explainability step in as sanity checks.

* Also, *SHAP* proved invaluable for trust-building â€” showing exactly how and why certain predictions were made, which is critical for real-world adoption in safety-critical domains.

### What's Next?
* Experiment with **ensemble stacking** of CatBoost and XGBoost.
* Introduce **geospatial** and **temporal data** (e.g., location clusters or time-based effects).
* Explore model **deployment** via a lightweight web dashboard for real-time risk scoring.

### Acknowledgements
This project was built using the [Road Accident Risk Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e10)
 from **Kaggle** â€” an open repository enabling data-driven learning and experimentation.

Gratitude to the original dataset contributors and the Kaggle community for providing transparent, high-quality data that allows data scientists to explore real-world challenges and build meaningful predictive models. Without such open collaboration, projects like this â€” blending data science, safety analytics, and practical modeling â€” wouldnâ€™t be possible.
